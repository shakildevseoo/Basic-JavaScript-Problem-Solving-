# JavaScript Basic Problem Solving

Welcome to my JavaScript Basic Problem Solving repository!  
This project showcases my solutions to a curated set of fundamental JavaScript problems, designed to strengthen core programming skills.

By solving these problems, I have deepened my understanding of JavaScript concepts such as:
- Variables
- Data Types
- Functions
- Arrays
- Math operations
- And more

This repository is perfect for beginners learning JavaScript or anyone interested in reviewing foundational programming exercises.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains solutions to **25 JavaScript problems**, divided into two levels:

### ✅ Basic Level 1:
Focuses on fundamental concepts like:
- Variable declaration
- Data types
- Objects
- Arrays
- Math methods
- Comparison operators

### ✅ Basic Level 2:
Covers more advanced beginner topics, including:
- Functions for temperature conversion
- Array manipulation
- String operations
- Mathematical computations like factorials

Each solution is implemented in clean, well-commented JavaScript code, making it easy to understand and follow.  
The problems are sourced from a comprehensive problem set (`problems.txt`), and the solutions are provided in a single JavaScript file (`js_problem_solving.js`).

## 🌟 Problem Highlights

### 🔹 Basic Level 1:
- Declaring and manipulating variables (e.g., assigning `"Volvo"` to `carName`)
- Working with objects to display formatted output (e.g., `"John is 50"`)
- Array operations like finding the length or updating elements
- Using `Math` methods for random numbers, max values, square roots
- Implementing comparison and ternary operators

### 🔹 Basic Level 2:
- Writing functions for tasks like Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
- Checking even/odd numbers and calculating factorials
- Finding smallest numbers, summing array elements, merging arrays
- String tasks like counting vowels, reversing, converting to lowercase

Each solution is tested using `console.log()` to ensure correctness and clarity.
